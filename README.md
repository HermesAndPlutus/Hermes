A general purpose signalling mechanism built on Ethereum.

Anyone can create a issue/proposal and anyone can signal their preference for or against any issue/proposal by sending ETH to the for or against receiveing address.

Signals are interpreted by the front-end.

Our frontend will interpret the signals quadratically, using BrightID as a proof of uniqueness. But we encourage others to build alternate frontends that interpret signals differently.
