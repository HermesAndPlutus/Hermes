# Hermes
## A general purpose signaling mechanism built on Ethereum.

Named for messenger of the gods, Hermes is a general purpose signaling mechanism for the Ethereum ecosystem.

Anyone can create an issue on which anyone can signal their preference for or against by sending any amount of ETH to the corresponding Ethereum address.

Signals are interpreted client-side

Initially, our frontend will interpret the signals quadratically, using BrightID as a proof of uniqueness. But we hope to build out a variety of different methods for analyzing signals.

Currently, all ether collected from signaling is burned so as to prevent feedback. However, future iterations may reallocate collected funds via some fund allocation mechanism.

Hermes operates under the premise that any arbitrary definition of stakeholder groups will necessarily disenfranchise some people. Rather than attempting to define stakeholder groups and weight their input against one and other, Hermes attempts to create a signaling environment that is permissionless, non-exclusive, collusion resistant, and minimally impacted by plutocracy.
